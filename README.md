# 🎬 MovieZone

**MovieZone** is a simple and beginner-friendly React application that displays a list of movies and allows users to **filter them based on genre**. This app was built as part of my [30 Days of React Learning Series](https://www.linkedin.com/) to practice React fundamentals like state management and dynamic rendering.
